    "\n",
    "1. In your current working directory, create a new text file called \"Test.py\". Open \"Test.py\" in a text editor, define a simple string inside the file, and type the command to print that string i.e.\n",

    "        \n",
    "  save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now in this Jupyter Notebook, enter the command `run Test.py`. In another cell, check if you have access to the variable named `word`? *Note that you must have the Jupyter notebook open in the same directory where \"Test.py\" is saved. To check, type* `ls` *in a notebook code cell, you should see an output of the current working directory listing and \"Test.py\" should be listed here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now restart the Kernel and try `import Test` in another cell of the notebook. Do you have access to the variable `word` from this import? Try the 'dot' notation i.e. type `Test.` and then use the Tab key to see available completions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, open \"Test.py\" in your text editor and change the string in the variable `word` to something different. Try `run Test.py` and `import Test` again. What do you notice?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a simple python function in the file \"test.py\" and save the file. Example function:\n",

    "    \n",
    "7. From the Jupyter notebook menu, click 'Kernel' ->  'Restart & Clear Output'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In the Jupyter notebook, run `Import Test`, again.  Can you access and use your function? (Use the dot notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Try the command `run Test.py` again. Can you access and use your function? \n",
    "\n",

    "           \n",
    "           \n",
